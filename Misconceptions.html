     		<h2>Water producdes a high amount of your carbon footprint: You may think that something as basic as water would be safe and ideal to the enviroment. But surprisingly  the electricity used in maintaining  and purifying water is  the reason of how it can produce a high carbon footprint.</h2>

     		<h3> Germany is the country with the highest carbon footprint in Europe; This may be as shocker since studies shown that China is on top of  pack of carbon footprint reduction. But for one concentrated area in The UK, Germany has a carbon footprint of 767.1 million metric  tonnes. A potentail reason for such a high production is ironically enough its renewable engery  is partly the reason.Although healthy for the enviroment at the same time they require massive electricity  to power which  can be a reason in a a spike of their carbon footprint in the region </h3>
