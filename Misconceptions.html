     		<p>Water producses a high amount of your carbon footprint: You may think that something as basic as water would be safe and ideal to the enviroment. But surprisingly  the electricity used in maintaining  and purifying water is how it can produce a high carbon footprint.</p>
     		<p2> Germany is the country with the highest carbon footprint in Europe; This may be a shocker since studies show that China is on top of  pack of carbon footprint reduction. But for one concentrated area in The UK, Germany has a carbon footprint of 767.1 million metric  tonnes. A potentail reason for such a high production is ironically enough its renewable engery is partly the reason. Although healthy for the enviroment at the same time they require massive electricity to power which can be a reason in a a spike of their carbon footprint in the region </p2>
