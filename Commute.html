		<p> Thankfully, average fuel economy of cars in the US is on an upward trend. But gasoline is still the primary source of fuel for cars, the combustion of which produces about 9 thousand grams, or about 19 pounds of carbon dioxide. And CO2 emissions are nearly 100 pounds more per meter today than in any other time in recorded history. That's why looking for ways to reduce your carbon foot print is more important than ever. By reducing car use to use even just one less gallon of gas per week, we can make a positive impact on our environment!</p>

		<h2>Walking</h2>
		<p>For car users, choosing to walk is as green as it gets. By choosing to walk just 20 minutes a day in place of using a car to get to wherever you need to go, you could reduce your carbon footprint by 19 pounds of carbon dioxide in less than a month, if not in less time.</p>
		<h2>Bicycling</h2>
		<p>As with walking, it's zero-emissions, but with the added benefit of low-impacting aeoribic cardiovascular exercise. This means it's low stress on any joints as well as similar health benefits to walking such as low blood pressure and improved cardiovascular health. </p>
